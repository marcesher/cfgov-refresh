        <h2 class="h3">Preparing a résumé to apply to a federal government position</h2>
        <p>
            It is important not to leave something out
            just because it seems less relevant to you.
            Federal hiring will always take into account the full breadth of your experience.
            If something is listed under “minimum qualifications required,”
            your application must demonstrate that you have
            experience relevant to that qualification.
            It is also important that you do not make assumptions about what qualifies.
            If the announcement says a particular type of experience is required,
            do not list a similar but different type of experience
            without explaining how it meets the qualification.
            If you have that exact experience, always state it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are welcome to say more than this, of course,
            and it can help later in the process.
            Once the process moves past the initial round of review,
            people will take a closer look at the patterns of your experience
            rather than just the broadest facts.

        <h2 class="h3">Federally recognized status and eligibility for a position</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes very similar jobs will be posted simultaneously,
            with one of the primary differences being who is eligible to apply.
            This difference is based on the applicant’s employment history
            or other federally recognized status.
            For example, some jobs are limited to current and former federal employees only.
            In general, if you see two similar jobs that interest you,
            we recommend applying through the description
            that applies most closely to your experience and status.
            You are, however, welcome to apply to any vacancy at any time.
